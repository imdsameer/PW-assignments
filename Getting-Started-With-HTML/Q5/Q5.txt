Q5)What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?


Answer: 
A DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers.
The DOCTYPE declaration is not an HTML tag. It is a special line of code that is placed at the very beginning of the HTML document. The syntax of the DOCTYPE declaration depends on the version of HTML that is being used.
For example, the DOCTYPE declaration for HTML5 is:

<!DOCTYPE html>
